##I'm learning about code chunks

farce <- 1:29

##print farce
farce

##what is the mean of farce?
mean(farce)

##let's see how elements are numbered when asked for output

seq(from = 0, to = 120, by = 3)
##R is not ready (+)
## (+) symbol means that R is Waiting for you to (properly) finish code you started before
##R is ready (>)

##playing with commas and periods
mean(c(22557, 4520, 2))
#mean(c(22557, 4520. 2))
##error you should see Error: unexpected numeric constant in "mean(c(22557, 4520. 2"
